This repo contains examples of MVU pattern (the Elm architecture), implemented in V programming language.
The MVU is an alternative to MVC and MVVM patterns and can be used in UI, web, and game apps.

The logic of the pattern is pretty simple:
- you have a Model that defines your data
- you have an Update that reacts to Messages and returns updated Model
- you have a View that displays your current Model

You can read more [here](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).
